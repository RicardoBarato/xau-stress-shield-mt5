# Publication Guard Review 22001

## Candidate

XAU

## Changes

- Guard policy terms are stored encoded rather than as literal public text.
- Guard tests now verify both a clean pass and a controlled rejection case.
- Forbidden file extensions remain blocked.
- Path, private-root, sensitive artifact, and cross-project contamination checks remain part of the publication gate.

## Result

Publication guard passes locally after hardening. The guard is ready for human review, but publication remains blocked until the final repository strategy is approved.
